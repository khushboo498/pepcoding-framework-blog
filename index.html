				<h2 class="heading2">What are frameworks?</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">Frameworks are tools that are there to make a coder’s life easier and make their work efficient. How? Imagine you are writing a story. But every time you make a typo you must start all over again. Or you are cycling down the street but at every bump the cycle breaks to pieces and you must build it all over again. Does that sound tempting?</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Exactly. Frameworks are things that are designed to make programmers’ life less troublesome by providing solutions to already dealt with problems in coding. But it is important to remember that unlike libraries that give solutions to a specific problem, they form the base of your application.</p>

				<h3 class="heading3"> <span><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></span> Solving common problems</h3>
				<p class="paragraph">Routing and templating, two of the most common problems that web applications need to solve, are swiftly handled by the frameworks.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">They basically prevent you from reinventing the wheel, which in the software world means solving the common problems that already have a ready-made solution.</p>

				<h3 class="heading3"><span><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></span> Enhance the quality</h3>
				<p class="paragraph">If you have already learned the languages, learning frameworks would be easier as these frameworks are also made by coding languages. When applied, they fulfil their specific purpose. Since frameworks take care of the primary things, you can direct your creativity towards creating better user interface design, better performing functions and smoother user experience by using threads.</p>

				<h3 class="heading3"> <span><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></span> Strengthen security</h3>
				<p class="paragraph">Using framework solutions are much more safe and secure. That’s why frameworks are quite often used for a variety of purposes such as authentication, authorization, email verification, etc.</p>

				<h2 class="heading2">Types of Frameworks</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">There are a variety of frameworks for the diverse needs that occur in the programming world. These are divided in the following 3 categories.</p>

				<h3 class="heading3"><span><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></span> Web frameworks</h3>
				<p class="paragraph">These are the most utilized frameworks. Back end web frameworks help people build web applications. Commonly used web frameworks are Ruby on rails, Laravel, Django and Angular.</p>

				<h3 class="heading3"><span><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></span> Front end framework</h3>
				<p class="paragraph">Front-end frameworks are used by developers using technologies like html, CSS and Javascript. To create nice applications. And everything is well executed in the user's browser.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Most popular ones are <b>angular</b> and <b>react</b>.</p>

				<h3 class="heading3"><span><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></span> Mobile app development frameworks</h3>
				<p class="paragraph">Now it is one of the most in demand skills because of the growing web development market. Flutter, Xamarin, Ionic, React and Native are the most used frameworks in this category.</p>

				<h2 class="heading2">Is learning Frameworks necessary to get a job as a programmer?</h2>
				<p class="paragraph"><i>Now coming to the main question, is learning frameworks necessary to get a job as a programmer?</i></p>
				<p class="paragraph">As you will know, you learn coding languages to be able to create websites, analyse data and automate DevOps. Therefore, learning languages is the foundation of becoming a programmer, but learning frameworks can assist you in using those languages to solve more complex problems and creative solutions. Free from coding the basic and mundane things over and over again, you can maybe work on making your website more aesthetically pleasing. What’s more, it enhances security and makes getting help from other coders easy. Overall, it enables you to create flawless interactive applications. We recommend you learn frameworks, along with the dynamic languages you must already be learning, to level up your coding performance. If you plan to enhance your coding skills and get a job as a programer, you should consider taking a course at <a href="https://www.pepcoding.com/" target="_blank">Pepcoding</a>. Its First Job Program takes 3rd and 4th year students and leads them to their goal of placement in well-paying product based companies.</p>

				<h2 class="heading2">Is learning frameworks enough for getting a job as a programmer?</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">Merely learning coding languages and their frameworks might not be enough to get a job as what they're really looking for is your expertise in one or many skills needed for that role.</p>

				<p class="paragraph">You can get your expertise in</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Web Applications</li>
					<li>Machine Learning and AI</li>
					<li>Task Automation</li>
					<li>Data Science</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="paragraph">But along with specialisation in these skills, you also need technical versatility to increase your employability. For instance, if you have mastered Python, you may also want to learn Javascript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Along with these, you must also work upon your general abilities like design skills, deep learning, problem solving ability and communication skills. Soft skills play a major role in helping you cross the threshold and crack the final interview.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">As a developer, your job includes writing code, testing, and fixing bugs. But for various job roles there are other requirements too, so you need to acquire more skills. For example, in machine learning you need to be familiar with mathematical modelling.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">To get a holistic preparation for your programming job, check out <a href="https://www.pepcoding.com/" target="_blank"></a>NADOS where you can get ample opportunity to learn frameworks and a lot more skills and practice them.</p>
